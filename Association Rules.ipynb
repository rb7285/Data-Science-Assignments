    "1. What is lift and why is it important in Association rules?\n",
    "-> Lift measures the strength of an association rule compared to random chance, indicating the likelihood of one item occurring \n",
    "   with another. A lift greater than 1 shows a positive association.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. What is support and Confidence. How do you calculate them?\n",
    "-> Support is the frequency of an itemset in the dataset, while Confidence indicates the reliability of a rule. They are \n",
    "   calculated as:\n",
    "   Support = (Transactions with itemset) / (Total transactions)\n",
    "   Confidence = (Transactions with both A and B) / (Transactions with A)\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. What are some limitations or challenges of Association rules mining?\n",
    "-> Challenges of Association Rule Mining include scalability, as larger datasets require more resources; interpretability, \n",
    "   since many complex rules can emerge; and overfitting, where the model captures noise rather than genuine patterns.\n",
